# i40e driver sometimes bugs with RSS. Interrupt counters freezes 
# and all packet processing is doing by CPU0. Enabling and disabling
# RPS enables RSS, IDK why. Enabling both RPS and RSS is bad idea,
# so we disable it later don't use this script periodically, it can
# cause packet drops. Only required for system startup.
