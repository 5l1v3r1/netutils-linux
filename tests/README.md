Most utils are designed to be tested without need to have a real hardware (there should be a lot different machines for every developer). Almost every utility allows to specify "test" data source such as lscpu's output, /proc/interrupts or /proc/net/softnet_stat files' snapshot etc.

This directory contains few snapshots for autotests. Unfortunatedly they aren't standardized yet.
